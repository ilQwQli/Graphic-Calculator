# Work Report for Graphics Calculator

## Name: Kevin Cao

## Features:
  This is a graphics calculator capable of graphing many features in a graphics calculator
  It has a interactable textbox input and a input history table that can interacted and 
  output graphs. It's also capable of moving the graph and zoom the graph in and out

<br><br>

- User Manual:
  - arrow key for different direction of pan
  - mouse scroll wheel for zoom in and out
  - textbox can be directly used, backspace for delete last character
  - F1 to clear the textbox
  - left click the slots to choose which function to output
  - right click to delete the selected function
  - ESC or press top right red X to close window
  - R to reset the graph back to origin center position
  
- Implemented:
  - basic math calculation
  - trig calculations
  - max and min calculation
  - pi is included
  - real time user input text box
  - interactive function history with delete option
  - zoom and pan for graph

- Partly implemented:
  - what features have not been implemented

# Note:

- This is a early stage small project I've done back when I was still learning C++
- Many part of the code still could've been improved and simplified
- Many features were still possibly could be added like selecting multiple graphs
